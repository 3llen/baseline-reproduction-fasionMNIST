Abstract
This project attempts to reproduce as well as improve the baseline accuracy from Bhatnagar,
Ghosal and Kolekarâ€™s paper for the classification task of fashion article images obtained from
the Fashion-MNIST dataset.  In the first part of the project, we attempt to reproduce the SVC
baseline for the classification task, and obtained an accuracy score of
0.8986
, which is slightly
higher than the accuracy of
0.8970
in the original paper.  Then, we tried to improve the SVC
baseline  by  hyper-parameter  tuning,  involving  different  SVC  kernel  trials,  different  C-values
and different gamma values of the SVC models.  Our best performing model with polynomial
kernel (degree = 2 and
C
= 10
.
0) achieved a test accuracy of
0.8950
whereas the best performing
classifier with the RBF kernel (gamma = 0.001 and
C
= 10
.
0) resulted in an accuracy of
0.8970
.
We also implemented a Convolutional Neural Network model that has around 1% increase in
accuracy  compared  to  the  CNN  models  in  the  original  paper,  with  a  test  accuracy  score  of
0.9355
